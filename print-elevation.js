    // Input is an array of ints
    // Highest point will need to print first

    // Question everything?
    
    // DO I need to find the highest point?
    // No, idea A eliminates the need for the highest point.

    // 2 ideas
        // A) Loop through array and create string of characters if the int is >= iteration #
            // Loop through array for m where m = highest point
        // B) Find the highest point, createa  2d array where inner array count is equal to highest point and translate the ints into the 2d array. Then print that array.
            // Sort - O(nlogn) -- space lots of array space needed
